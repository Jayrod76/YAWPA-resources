- Replace "sample_json" with whatever you want to call your walls, something like "dope_walls" works

- Upload your wallpapers to either Imgur or some where that allows direct links. 

- Create as many url slots as you need then replace FULL_IMAGE_URL in "url": "FULL_IMAGE_URL" with your own

- You also need to create a thumbnail for your images.The smaller the better.

- Submit a pull request and wait for approval


# NOTES

- Make sure the last url slot does not have a comma with the bracket

- Use direct links ONLY. This is VERY important!

- DO NOT use dropbox or risk having your account suspended due to traffic (their policy afaik)
